# My Spring AI Trail
The goal was to practice. I read on spring ai and also watched YouTube all described below.

### Technological stack
* Java 21 (OpenJDK)
* Spring Boot 3.5.7 (Latest stable as of October 2025)
* Spring AI 1.0.3 (Latest stable as of October 2025)
* Postgresql DB + PGVector ([Postgres Vector extension](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/pgvector-050-released-2700/))

### Before you start
* Generate a dedicated OpenAPI key.
* Locate your pdf within pdfs folder or use mine ([Olymic Games wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games))  

### Roadmap
- [ ] Dynamic load of all pdfs for their folder.
- [ ] Once loaded, allow querying more than once.
